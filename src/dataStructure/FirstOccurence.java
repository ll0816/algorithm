 First Occurrence

 Given a target integer T and an integer array A sorted in ascending order, find the index of the first occurrence
 of T in A or return -1 if there is no such index.

 There can be duplicate elements in the array.
 A = {1, 2, 3}, T = 2, return 1
 A = {1, 2, 3}, T = 4, return -1
 A = {1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, T = 2, return 1

 What if A is null or A of zero length? We should return -1 in this case.
